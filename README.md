Validate Redirects
==================

Validate a list of redirects

1) Parse a file ( or list of redirects ) and validate if the Redirect is working on Redirecting to other urls or loops.
2) Create a list based on the following
  a) 200 - 1 Jump Redirect 
  b) 301 - Multiple Redirects
  c) 404 - No Longer Working
  d) 500 - Something went wrong
  e) Other - Other cases ( may add more HTTP codes later )
